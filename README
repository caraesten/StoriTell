This is the CMS behind StoriTell.com.

If you understand Python, you can get your own version of the site
up and running fairly quickly.

REQUIRES:

Django
Haystack
Django_evolution
Tastypie
jQuery

A BRIEF NOTE ABOUT TEMPLATES:

I'm including them as-is. Please modify them to suit your liking. 
The CSS is also included.

Here are the descriptions of the different apps:

==========
Stories
==========
The main part of the site, stories manages all of the stories themselves.

Contains models for IP address and story, as well as all Ajax functions
on the site.

==========
Quotes
==========
App for the random quote generator. Probably should be within stories.


==========
Cust_comments
==========
StoriTell's subclass of the Django comments app. Includes comment
upvoting/downvoting.

==========
Tastypie
==========
Tastypie is a django app designed to provide an easy-to-use REST-ful
API. It's hosted here: https://github.com/toastdriven/django-tastypie.

If you plan on using it, delete this folder and get the updated version.
I probably shouldn't include it and will likely remove it from the repo
in the future.
